## About this project

This repository contains a wiki dedicated to learn how to use Unity3D in an easy way.
It was created out of a continuing need to answer questions that new Unity3D developers had that were not clearly answered in the official Unity3D documentation.
As a result, an effort by the community of Unity developers has been made to create this wiki and its contents.
